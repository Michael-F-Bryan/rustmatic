# Rustmatic

Rustmatic is an attempt at creating a PLC like environment programmable in Rust. 

It's currently in the brainstorming, proof-of-concept phase.
All suggestions etc. are welcome.

# Goals

* Permissive License, Apache 2.0
* Leverage Embedded Working Group Software where applicable 
* For the casual PLC programmer: High focus on simplicity and ergonomics, without having to know advanced Rust
* The advanced PLC programmer will still have the complete Rust toolbox available
* Ergonomics in use: Download, monitoring in run
* Standardized functions for starting/stopping/diagnosing the runtime
* Standardized interfaces to fieldbus protocols
* Graphical programming in LAD, SFC?
* Single stepping, single cycle
* Standardized interface to HMI
